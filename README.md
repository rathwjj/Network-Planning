# Home Network and Automation Planning Guide

## Introduction

This guide outlines the planning process for setting up a home network and automation system. It helps you visualize your space, organize your devices, and make informed decisions about protocols, cabling, and server architecture. The goal is to reduce trial-and-error during installation by thinking everything through in advance.

## Planning Steps

1. **Create a floor plan.**

2. **List your desired features.**  
   Decide what devices you want, where to place them, and which types of media (wired/wireless) to use.

3. **Inventory all required devices.**  
   Include switches, routers, Wi-Fi access points, beacons, repeaters, and antennas.

4. **Check power consumption.**  
   Ensure your setup is energy-efficient and your electrical capacity is sufficient.

5. **Evaluate home automation protocols.**  
   Choose the best protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Matter) for your specific use cases.

6. **Plan cabling.**  
   Check both power cabling and Ethernet runs â€” consider lengths, quality, and layout.

7. **Determine server needs.**  
   - Will you combine home automation, file storage, and firewall into one server?  
   - Or separate them into dedicated servers?  
   - Do you also need a frontend proxy server?
